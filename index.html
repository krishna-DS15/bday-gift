            <h2>About Very Busy</h2>
            <p>
                Busy, you're the most important person to me. Our bond should last forever. 💖  
                From irritating me 😤, playing with me 🎮, and making me pissed off 🤬—I give you full rights to annoy me for a lifetime! 😆  
                You are the person I want in my life forever! Since I can’t fit everything into one paragraph, here’s a feature breakdown of you! 📜

        <div class="features">
            <h2>🌟 Features of Very Busy... ta da! 🌟</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>💡 Super Intelligent (Every time I say this, she gets happy. But is she...?? 🤔)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Being honest—when I first met her, she was super intelligent. But after spending time with me… she became dumb or maybe just acts dumb. 😆</li>
                        <li>She’s great at learning new things—especially new ways to irritate me. 🤦‍♂️  
                            She comes up with a variety of creative (and evil 😈) ways to mess with me. Big brain moves! 🧠</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>❤️ Always Caring and Supportive
                    <ul>
                        <li>Uh-oh… I’m about to get emotional 😭. I’ve hurt her many times (unintentionally), but she always cares for me and supports me. Tears dropping 😢</li>
                        <li>Sometimes she gives the best advice (but let’s be honest, I usually don’t listen to her 🤭). Sorry, Busy! 🙈</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>🎯 Focused & Hardworking
                    <ul>
                        <li>She works VERY HARD... especially when it comes to finding new ways to piss me off. 🤬  
                            Also, she’s super focused on every single word I say—just to twist my words and ask weird questions. HOW?! 😵‍💫</li>
                        <li>Jokes aside, sometimes she actually inspires me with her dedication and hard work. Rare moments, but true! 😜</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>🌍 Independent and Strong
                    <ul>
                        <li>She’s independent and strong because she somehow manages me (which is NOT easy). Props to her! 🎖️👏</li>
                        <li>Never afraid to irritate me or even beat me up when needed. Ouch. Send help. 🚑😂</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>😆 Fun and Full of Energy
                    <ul>
                        <li>She enjoys annoying me, and that gives her immense satisfaction. After that, she can sleep peacefully. I suffer. 😭</li>
                        <li>Always ready to fight with me, play with me, and mess around.  
                            And guess what? I want this to continue FOREVER. Be my friend for life, Busy! 💖🎊</li>
